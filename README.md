DronePath-MIP: Multi-Drone Inspection OptimizerThis project provides a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solution for the Minimax Multi-Drone Traveling Salesman Problem (MDTSP). It optimizes the flight trajectories for a fleet of 4 drones tasked with inspecting 3D coordinates on building surfaces111111111.🎯 ObjectiveThe primary goal is to minimize the makespan—the time taken by the last drone to return to the base point—ensuring that every measurement point is visited exactly once by exactly one drone2.⚙️ Optimization FeaturesCustom Kinematics: Travel times account for directional speeds: 1.0 m/s upward, 2.0 m/s downward, and 1.5 m/s horizontal333333333.Geometric Connectivity: Arcs are generated based on a dual-threshold system:Euclidean distance $\le$ 4m4.Euclidean distance $\le$ 11m if at least two coordinates differ by $\le$ 0.5m5.Mathematical Model: Implemented using python-mip, the model includes:Linearized Minimax objective function6.Flow conservation and node coverage constraints7777.Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) subtour elimination8.🚀 UsageThe script is built to be executed via terminal and accepts a CSV file containing $(x, y, z)$ coordinates as an argument9.Bash# Execute the optimizer for Building 1
