DronePath-MIP: Multi-Drone Inspection OptimizerThis repository provides a Mathematical Optimization solution for a fleet of $k=4$ drones tasked with analyzing building facades111111111. It implements a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model to solve the Minimax Multi-Drone Traveling Salesman Problem (MDTSP)2222.🎯 Project ObjectiveThe goal is to determine optimal 3D trajectories such that every measurement point on a building grid is visited by exactly one drone, starting and ending at a common base333333333. The objective function minimizes the makespan—the total flight time of the last drone to return to base4444.⚙️ Technical Features1. Custom Kinematics & Travel TimesTravel times ($t_{ij}$) are calculated based on directional speed rules5555:Upward: 1.0 m/s6.Downward: 2.0 m/s7.Horizontal: 1.5 m/s8.Oblique: Calculated as $\max(\frac{\text{lateral distance}}{1.5}, \frac{\text{vertical distance}}{v_{\text{vertical}}})$9.2. Geometric Connectivity RulesThe model generates a sparse graph where nodes are only connected if101010101010101010:Euclidean distance $\le$ 4m11.Euclidean distance $\le$ 11m AND at least two coordinates differ by $\le$ 0.5m12.Base Connections: Drones can always travel between the base and specified "entry points" ($y \le -12.5$ for Building 1; $y \le -20$ for Building 2)13131313.3. Optimization Model (MIP)Implemented using python-mip, the formulation includes14:Makespan Linearization: Using dummy variable $T$15.Flow Conservation: Ensures drones enter and leave nodes correctly16.Subtour Elimination: Implements Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) constraints to prevent disconnected cycles17.🚀 UsageThe script main.py is designed to be executed via terminal and accepts a CSV file containing $(x, y, z)$ coordinates as a command-line argument18181818.Terminal Commands:Bashpython main.py Edificio1.csv
Standard Output Format:The program produces the optimal makespan followed by the sequence of points for each drone19:PlaintextOptimal Makespan (T): 145.24
